    ## ðŸ“˜ Text Complexity Service

    This service analyzes a piece of text and returns multiple readability metrics to help evaluate how easy or difficult the text is to understand.

    It uses well-established formulas like Flesch-Kincaid, Gunning Fog, and SMOG to estimate the education level required to comprehend the text. It relies on the [textstat](https://pypi.org/project/textstat/) library for these calculations, which is a widely used library for text statistics in Python.
