    ## ðŸ’¬ Sentiment Analysis Service

    This service analyzes a piece of text and returns a confidence score for each of the following sentiment categories:
    - positive
    - neutral
    - negative

    It leverages the [cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment-latest](https://huggingface.co/cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment-latest) model. This model is designed for robust sentiment classification on social media and short-form content like tweets, captions, and comments.

    The input text can be of any lengthâ€”long texts are intelligently chunked, processed individually, and aggregated to produce a final sentiment distribution.
